# Booky

Booky is an application to get book from [Library Genesis](https://libgen.rs/) and to manage books. Booky is built with React Native Expo, fully written in Typescript, and uses [Material 3](https://m3.material.io) design. This project is to illustrate some React Native patterns and good practice that I gained from my experience and is an educationnal purpose project.

This is a non-official [Library Genesis](https://libgen.rs/) mobile client.

The project is completely independent and Open Source. 
The developer has no relation with [Library Genesis](https://libgen.rs/).

Publishing a copy of this application on the Play Store will only get your account banned.
